# ZKB Project
## An attempt to organize various things I've learned over the years

## Usage
* Rename `blank-kb.json` (or don't..)
* Create `config.json`, filling in your KB filename, webserver port, list of discord user ids (who will have write access through the bot), and your bot's token. An example is provided in `config-example.json`.
* `npm install & npm start`
